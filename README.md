RESULTS - Synopsis

The Conversion Funnel for the e-commerce company's website resulted in 3 stages: view, shopping_cart, and purchase.  The total conversion rate calculated the percentage of the purchase stage from the view stage resulted in 10.34% and the conversion rate calculated the percentage of the purchase stage from the shopping cart stage resulted in 35.61%.  The total conversion rate and conversion rate resulted in 29.04%.  In conclusion, the biggest drop is between the view stage and shopping cart stage resulted in over a 70% drop.  Improving the total conversion and conversion rates from the view stage to the shopping cart stage will boost purchases based on the purchase conversion rate percentage of 35.61%, from the shopping cart conversion rate of 29.04%.

The Retention Rates for the e-commerce company was organized by 5 different cohorts covering 4 months.  Cohort 9/1/2020 had the highest retention rate in month 1 than any other cohort.  The 10/1/2020 cohort is the only cohort to have at least a retention rate in all 4 months.  Cohort 1/1/2021 only had a retention rate in the first month and 0% retention rate for the remaining 3 months.  Three out of 5 cohorts had 0% retention rates within month 4.  A retention rate around or during the upcoming holidays were established by each cohort.  In conclusion, the cohorts' retention rates depended on when the specific cohort started and ended the 4 month period and what events were happening during the 4 month periods.
